        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Article 3 - Access to the Application</h2>
            <h3>3.1. Target Audience</h3>
            <p>The Application is exclusively reserved for professionals. The User declares to be a duly authorized professional driver (e.g., practicing as a freelancer, micro-entrepreneur, transport company, VTC, taxi, etc.), using the Application within the strict scope of their professional activity. The Application is not intended for consumer individuals acting outside of any professional activity. The Publisher reserves the right to restrict access to the Application to any user not meeting these criteria.</p>
            
            <h3>3.2. Technical Conditions</h3>
            <p>To access the Application, the User must have compatible equipment (smartphone or tablet) and internet access. Any connection costs (mobile plan, data, etc.) are borne by the User. It is the User's responsibility to ensure that their technical configuration and environment (updated operating system, etc.) are compatible with PickUp Go. The Publisher cannot be held liable if the Application proves incompatible or functions in a degraded manner due to the User's equipment or settings.</p>
            
            <h3>3.3. Download</h3>
            <p>The Application is available for free download on the App Store (iOS) and the Google Play Store (Android). The downloading of the Application may be subject to the conditions of the download platforms, which the User also agrees to respect. Full access to PickUp Go Services requires the subscription to a plan as defined in Article 5 below.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Article 4 - Account Creation and Registration</h2>
            <h3>4.1. Account Opening</h3>
            <p>Use of PickUp Go Services requires the creation of a User account. Upon first opening the Application, the User must register by providing the required information (professional email address, phone number, full name or company name, company information if applicable). The User agrees to provide accurate, complete, and up-to-date information. The use of pseudonyms or misleading information is prohibited.</p>
            
            <h3>4.2. Confidentiality of Credentials</h3>
            <p>Upon account creation, the User chooses a password. These credentials are personal, confidential, and the responsibility of the User. It is the User's responsibility to ensure the security and confidentiality of their password and not to disclose it to third parties. Each User account is individual: it must not be shared or transferred to another person. The User is responsible for any activity or action performed via their account. In the event of unauthorized use of their account or suspicion of a security breach of their credentials, the User must immediately inform the Publisher at <a href="mailto:support@pickupgo.cloud" style="color:#0066cc;">support@pickupgo.cloud</a>.</p>
            
            <h3>4.3. Eligibility</h3>
            <p>By creating an account, the User certifies that they are at least 18 years old and have the full legal capacity to contract and use the Application within the scope of their professional activity. If representing a legal entity (e.g., manager of a transport company), they guarantee they are authorized to bind said legal entity. The Publisher reserves the right to request any proof verifying the User's professional status (e.g., SIRET number, transport license, etc.) and to suspend or delete the account if the User does not meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Article 5 - Subscription and Financial Terms</h2>
            <h3>5.1. Principle of Subscription</h3>
            <p>PickUp Go operates on the basis of a paid monthly subscription, granting access to all Application Services. The subscription is purchased directly via the download platform used by the User (App Store for iOS or Google Play for Android) using the In-App Purchase system. Subscription rates, expressed in Euros inclusive of all taxes, are displayed on the subscription page at the time of purchase. By subscribing, the User agrees to pay the indicated price on a recurring basis.</p>
            
            <h3>5.2. Duration and Automatic Renewal</h3>
            <p>The Subscription is concluded for a monthly duration starting from the date of subscription, with automatic renewal for successive one-month periods. This means that, unless terminated by the User under the conditions of Article 6 below, the subscription will be automatically renewed each month on the anniversary date of the subscription, for an additional month, at the rate then in effect.</p>
            
            <h3>5.3. Billing and Payment</h3>
            <p>Payment of the monthly Subscription is managed exclusively by the platform (App Store or Google Play) according to the payment method associated with the User's account on said platform. No payment information (credit card number, etc.) is collected or processed directly by the Publisher. The subscription amount is debited at the initiative of the platform, on the monthly renewal date. In case of payment failure (e.g., expired card, insufficient funds), the Application may no longer be accessible in subscriber mode until regularization.</p>
            
            <h3>5.4. Free Trial Period</h3>
            <p>The subscription may be offered with a free trial period. In this case, specific terms (duration of the trial, automatic billing after the trial, etc.) will be specified upon subscription. The User may cancel their subscription at any time during the trial period without being charged.</p>
            
            <h3>5.5. No Long-Term Commitment</h3>
            <p>The User is not committed to a fixed term beyond the current month. They may decide to terminate the Subscription at any time, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6.</p>
            
            <h3>5.6. Modification of Subscription Price</h3>
            <p>The Publisher reserves the right to modify the Subscription price. In the event of an increase in the monthly rate, the User will be informed in advance (by any appropriate means, for example via a message in the Application or a notification from the Apple/Google platform). The User will have the opportunity to terminate the Subscription before the new rate applies. Failing termination, the new rate will be deemed accepted and will be applied at the next monthly maturity date.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Article 6 - Termination of Subscription and Unsubscribing</h2>
            <h3>6.1. Termination by the User (Unsubscribing)</h3>
            <p>The User may stop the automatic renewal of their monthly Subscription at any time. Termination of the subscription (referred to as "unsubscribing") must be performed via the User's account settings on the download platform used (App Store or Google Play), in accordance with the procedures provided by Apple or Google:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>On iOS:</strong> Settings > [Your Name] > Subscriptions > PickUp Go > Cancel Subscription.</li>
                <li><strong>On Android:</strong> Google Play Store > Menu > Subscriptions > PickUp Go > Cancel Subscription.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once the unsubscribe request is made, the Subscription will remain active until the end of the current monthly period, and will then not be renewed. No termination fees apply.</p>
            
            <h3>6.2. No Pro-Rata Refund</h3>
            <p>In the event of unsubscribing during the month, the User retains access to the Services until the monthly maturity date, but cannot claim any partial refund for the period remaining until this date. The principle of the monthly subscription implies that any period commenced is due in full.</p>
            
            <h3>6.3. Termination/Suspension by the Publisher</h3>
            <p>In the event of a breach by the User of these Terms, particularly in case of non-compliance with the rules of use (Article 8) or violation of laws, the Publisher reserves the right to temporarily suspend the User's access to the Application, or to terminate the Subscription by right with immediate effect and deactivate the User's account, without refund of sums already paid.</p>
            
            <h3>6.4. Consequences of End of Subscription</h3>
            <p>In the event of termination or expiration of the Subscription, for whatever reason, the User loses access to the paid Services of PickUp Go. The User is informed that deleting the Application from their device or deleting their account does not automatically result in the termination of the paid subscription: they must imperatively unsubscribe via the App Store or Google Play to stop monthly debits.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Article 7 - Deletion of User Account</h2>
            <h3>7.1. Deletion Request by User</h3>
            <p>The User may decide to delete their PickUp Go account and associated data at any time. This account deletion request can be made:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>From the Application:</strong> Settings > My Account > Delete my account;</li>
                <li><strong>By email:</strong> By contacting <a href="mailto:support@pickupgo.cloud" style="color:#0066cc;">support@pickupgo.cloud</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Publisher undertakes to process any deletion request within a reasonable time and to confirm to the User that their request has been taken into account. Account deletion results in the deactivation of the User's access to the Application and the processing of their personal data in accordance with the Privacy Policy.</p>
            
            <h3>7.2. Warning - Active Subscription</h3>
            <p>As indicated in Article 6.4, deleting an account does not result in the automatic stop of the paid Subscription purchased via Apple or Google. It is the User's responsibility to unsubscribe beforehand via the download platform if they no longer wish to be charged. The Publisher strongly recommends that the User checks the status of their subscription in their Apple/Google account settings before proceeding with the permanent deletion of their PickUp Go account.</p>
            
            <h3>7.3. Deletion or Deactivation by the Publisher</h3>
            <p>The Publisher reserves the right to delete a User account in the event of prolonged inactivity (beyond 24 months without login, subject to prior notification to the User), or in the event of permanent discontinuation of the PickUp Go service.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

            <p>The PickUp Go Application, its logo, brand, trade name, content (software, source codes, design, interfaces, texts, images, graphics, etc.), and all elements composing it are the exclusive property of the Publisher. They are protected by copyright, trademark law, and any other intellectual property right in force.</p>
            <p>Subscribing to a plan does not entail any transfer of intellectual property to the User.
