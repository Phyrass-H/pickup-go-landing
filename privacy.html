            <h2>Data Collected</h2>
            <p>We collect different categories of personal data in order to provide and improve the PickUp Go service. This data includes specifically:</p>
            
            <h3>Device Permissions</h3>
            <p>The PickUp Go application may request access to the following features of your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> Used for route calculation, GPS navigation, and estimation of distances and travel times. You can disable this permission at any time in your device settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Used to send you ride reminders, booking confirmations, and flight tracking alerts. You can manage your notification preferences in the application settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Internet Access:</strong> Necessary to synchronize your data with our servers and access the application's online features.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>User and Company Information</h3>

            <h2>Purposes of Data Collection</h2>
            <p>The collected data is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Service Provision:</strong> Ensuring the proper functioning of the PickUp Go application and the provision of associated services (user account management, planning and tracking of rides, communication of ride information to relevant drivers and clients).</li>
                <li><strong>Improvement of User Experience:</strong> Improving our services and user experience by analyzing the operation of the application and ride histories to optimize routes, propose new features, or improve the interface.

These communications concern only the operation of the application and do not contain unsolicited commercial prospecting.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All uses of your personal data are based on an appropriate legal basis, either because they are necessary for the <strong>performance of the contract</strong> (use of the PickUp Go application), or based on our <strong>legitimate interest</strong> in improving our services. When required by law, we may also seek your specific consent.</p>

At the end of these two years, all of your personal data will be permanently deleted from our systems.</p>
